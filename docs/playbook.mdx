# AI Playbook

## Installing Cursor IDE

Step-by-Step:

1.  Visit the [Cursor Website](https://www.cursor.com/)
2.  Download and install the IDE for your OS
3.  Sign in with GitHub or supported login method
4.  (Optional but recommended) Sync settings with your GitHub profile
5.  Install Cursor on your device

## Prompt Best Practices

### Guiding Principle

AI works best when given clearly defined constraints and context.

To achieve this, we recommend two core strategies:

* Refine prompting techniques to improve clarity and intent.
* Decompose complex tasks into smaller, focused subtasks to reduce ambiguity.

### Strategy 1: Prompting

A well-formed prompt is the difference between usable code and irrelevant output. Here’s how to craft better prompts:

#### Do

* Include the **intent**: What do you want the code to do?
  * You can design effective prompts for various simple tasks by using commands to instruct the model what you want to achieve, such as "Write", "Modify", "Create", etc.
* Provide **structure**: Instructions, Inputs, Expected Outputs, Context.
    * Make the prompt as specific as possible. Try to make a prompt that contains any of the following elements:
        * **Instructions**: A specific task or instruction you want the model to perform.
        * **Inputs**: The input or question that we are interested in finding a response for.
        * **Expected Outputs**: The type or format of the output.
        * **Context**: External information or additional context that can steer the model to better responses. For example, you can address edge cases you would like the model to know.
* Instead of just saying what not to do, say what to do instead.
  * This encourages more specificity and focuses on the details that lead to good responses from the model.

#### Don't

* Avoid vague terms like "make this better" or "write the code".
* Don’t assume the AI knows your architecture or naming conventions unless you state them.

#### Example

**Bad Prompt:**

```
Create a login endpoint
```

**Better Prompt:**

```
Create a POST /login route. It should validate email and password, compare against a user record using bcrypt, and return a JWT. Please use these files as code style and architecture reference: 
1. [PATH TO ROUTES] 
2. [PATH TO HANDLER] 
3. [PATH TO SERVICE] 
4. [PATH TO REPOSITORY]
```

#### Tips

* You can provide context by referring to a file or folder, or even through images.
* To ensure naming conventions (although most of the time AI will do it by itself) you can create a blank file, folder, variables, functions etc, for AI to later complete with the functionality.
* It is much better if you can provide inline comments to help guide AI.

### Strategy 2: Break Down Complex Tasks

Large, abstract goals often lead to generic or bloated AI outputs. Instead, split the work into discrete units.

#### Example: Building a User Authentication System

Instead of asking:

```
Build user authentication
```

Break it down:

* Generate `POST /register` route with validation and hashed password.
* Generate `POST /login` route with JWT token issuance.
* Add middleware to validate JWT on protected routes.
* Write unit tests for `AuthService`.
* Generate OpenAPI docs for Auth endpoints.

This method:

* Makes AI output more reliable.
* Reduces the need for heavy edits.
* Increases code quality and maintainability.

#### Tips

* Think of a flow like a factory manufacturing products. It moves between processes with set input and output. Each process could be an optimal task for AI to do.
* It may be easier to iterate carefully between tasks and save (commit) your progress, in case of hallucinations, than to tell AI to straighten up a bug at the end of a long conversation.
* It’s okay to cancel out a long set of tasks if you are not satisfied with the results, for you to break them down smaller and re-iterate.

## Feedback

We’re at the early stage of adoption, any feedback provided would be helpful to construct a much better playbook. If you have any input or question, don’t hesitate to reach out.
