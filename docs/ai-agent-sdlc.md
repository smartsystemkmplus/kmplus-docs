## Example: Project Requirement Document
A well-written Project Requirement Document (PRD) is foundational for AI-powered workflows. Hereâ€™s an example structure:

---

# Project Requirement Document

## 1. Project Overview
Brief description of the project and its goals.

## 2. Tech Stack Preference
- Next.js
- Supabase
- (Other mainstream frameworks)

## 3. AI Model Usage Preference

## 4. Functional Requirements
- List of features and requirements.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria
- What does "done" look like for each feature?

## 6. Implementation Plan
- Stepwise plan for AI agent execution.
